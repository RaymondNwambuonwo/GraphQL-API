# GraphQL-Server-Project

# About

This was my first time working with GraphQL having taken a day or two to read up on and learn the basics as well as the advantages of GraphQL. Here I created a simple NodeJS and Express GraphQL API for songs and artist. This was a true educational experience as I was used to using REST, but I can see where GraphQL can have its advantages in regards to APIs.

## Technologies Used

1. GraphQL
2. NodeJS
3. Express
