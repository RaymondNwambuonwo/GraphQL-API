# GraphQL-Server-Project

# About

Practice with GraphQL. Here I created a simple NodeJS and Express GraphQL API for songs and artist. It possesses some CRUD functionality being able to create an artist or song and list all artists and songs. This was a true educational experience as I have been working REST traditionally, but I can see where GraphQL can have its advantages in regards to APIs.

## Technologies Used

1. GraphQL
2. NodeJS
3. Express
